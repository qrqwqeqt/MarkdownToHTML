# Markdown to HTML Converter

This is a simple Python script that converts Markdown files to HTML format. It takes a Markdown file as input and produces an HTML file as output.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/qrqwqeqt/MarkdownToHTML.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd MDtoHTML
    ```

## Usage

To use the Markdown to HTML converter, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `MDtoHTML.py` file.
3. Run the script with the following command:

    ```bash
    python MDtoHTML.py input.md output.html
    ```

    Replace `input.md` with the path to your Markdown file and `output.html` with the desired name for the HTML output file.

4. The HTML output file will be generated in the same directory.

## Example

Suppose you have a Markdown file named `example.md` with the following content:

```markdown
# Hello, Markdown!

This is **bold** text and this is _italic_ text.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
```

Running the following command:

```bash
python MDtoHTML.py example.md example.html
```

will generate an HTML file named `example.html` with the converted content.
